* tocinobot

This is a bot that recieves an url from twitter, facebook, youtube, whatever and download the video from it. It was made just to because I was boring so it is very possible that it is useless for many people.

** Setup

A few environment variables are required to setup this bot:

|--------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| TELEGRAM_API_ID    | api_id                 | You get it from https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id |
| TELEGRAM_API_HASH  | api_hash               | You get it from https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id |
| TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN | bot_token              | You get it from @BotFather                                     |
| SUPERADMIN         | your telegram username | It is used to tell the bot to respond only to you              |
|--------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|

Create a virtualenv with at least python 3.6 and install the dependencies using =pip install -r requirements.txt=. Also you'll need =youtube-dl= this program is who actually makes the magic. Then you can run the bot using =python bot.py=.

** Commands

- =users=: list the allowed users who can use this bot
- =add {username}=: add a user to the allowed users list
- =remove {username}=: remove a user from the allowed users list
- =download {url}=: download the video from the given url

Enjoy, maybe.
